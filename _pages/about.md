In my internship at CRUV, I developed over 15 screens and components for sturdy UIs using Flutter, ensuring seamless integration with back-end systems. I reduced load times by 30% while implementing RESTful APIs. Conducting A/B tests, I enriched the user experience, leading to a 20% increase in user satisfaction scores.

I have worked on projects like ElevenAI, an AI chat with real-time image generation, and a Yoga Lessons Platform, both created using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. These projects provided valuable experience in ensuring engaging user experiences. ElevenAI showcased AI's potential in engagement and creativity, while the Yoga-App offered a platform for sharing and learning yoga lessons.
