## Responsibilities

During the internship period with CRUV, I got the chance to work on several projects that substantially added to my technical and professional skills. I developed more than 15 screens and components' solid UIs using Flutter to ensure they integrated effortlessly with back-end systems. This opportunity made me realize that creating interfaces that are easy to use and visually appealing while maintaining robust performance is crucial. I achieved a 30% reduction in load times by successfully implementing RESTful APIs, consequently vastly improving user experiences. This included conducting A/B tests, resulting in a 20% increase in satisfaction, thereby demonstrating the impact of my work.

## What I Learned

Also, my internship with CRUV exposed me to the software development lifecycle. Working from home in West Bengal, India, I learned to work in a team, manage remote projects, and independently organize my tasks to accomplish them promptly. The experience has honed my problem-solving and time-management skills, enabling me to handle multiple projects and deadlines effectively. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work and research on existing full-stack Flutter projects, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the full-stack process. Primarily, this internship transformed me, equipping me for the challenges ahead in the technology market.
